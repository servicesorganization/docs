In Intune, you manage devices like Windows devices, Apple devices like Macbooks, iOS telephones and tablets or Android devices like telephones or tablets. For organization-owned devices, you may want full control over the devices, including settings, features, and security. In this approach, devices and users of these devices "enroll" in Intune. Once enrolled, they receive your rules and settings through policies configured in Intune. For example, you can set password and PIN requirements, create a VPN connection, set up threat protection, and more.

For personal devices, or bring-your-own devices (BYOD), users may not want their organization administrators to have full control. In this approach, give users options. For example, users enroll their devices if they want full access to your organization's resources. Or, if these users only want access to email or Microsoft Teams, then use app protection policies that require multi-factor authentication (MFA) to use these apps.

When devices are enrolled and managed in Intune, administrators can:

*   See the devices enrolled and get an inventory of devices accessing organization resources.
    
*   Configure devices, so they meet your security and health standards. For example, you probably want to block jailbroken devices.
    
*   Push certificates to devices so users can easily access your Wi-Fi network or use a VPN to connect to your network.
    
*   See reports on users and devices compliance.
    
*   Remove organization data if a device is lost, stolen, or not used anymore.
