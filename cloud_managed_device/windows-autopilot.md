Windows Autopilot is a collection of technologies that are used to set up and pre-configure new Windows devices so that they are ready for use by end users quickly. In addition, Windows Autopilot can be used to reset, re-use, or restore Windows devices.

The Windows Autopilot capability organizations can achieve capability described above with little to no infrastructure to manage through an Auto Pilot process this simplifies the process for both the end user and IT administrator.

The devices need to be registered in the Autopilot deployment program, this can be done automatically via an authorized vendor who purchased Windows devices and uploads the relevant information into the Intune web-portal of the organization. After registration, the Windows devices are fully configured without the need for additional actions by the end users.

The Windows Auto Pilot deployment program is capable to automate the following processes:

*   Add Windows devices to Azure Active Directory;
    
*   Automatically enroll the device into the Intune MDM solution;
    
*   Remove the administrator privileges for the end users (if necessary);
    
*   Automatic assign Windows devices to a specific configuration group;
    
*   A couple of lite adjustments to the Out-Of-The-Box experience.
    

From the moment the end users unboxed the device, only the following steps are required during the OOBE.

*   Selecting a preferred language and keyboard layout.
    
*   Connect to a (WIFI) network.
    
*   Enter the primary e-mail address (Azure AD account) and password.
    

Multiple additional configuring setting can be skipped during the enrollment process because of the device is automatically recognized as belonging to an organization. After this process, the device is connected to Azure Active Directory and enrolled in Microsoft Intune. The MDM enrollment ensures that the predefined policy is applied, apps are installed, and settings are configured on the device. Windows update for business applies the latest updates to ensure that the device is up to date.

Windows Autopilot can also provide a white glove service that enables partners or IT staff to pre-provision a Windows 10 device so that it is fully configured and business-ready. From the end userâ€™s perspective, the Windows Autopilot user-driven experience is unchanged, but getting their device to a fully provisioned state is faster.
