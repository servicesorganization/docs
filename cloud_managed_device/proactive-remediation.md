Proactive remediations are script packages that can detect and fix common support issues on a user's device before they even realize there's a problem. These remediations can help reduce support calls. Each script package consists of a detection script, a remediation script, and metadata. Through Intune, you can deploy these script packages and see reports on their effectiveness.
