Associate your Microsoft Store for Business account with Intune
---------------------------------------------------------------

Before you enable synchronization in the Intune console, you must configure your store account to use Intune as a management tool:

1.  Ensure that you sign into the [Microsoft Store for Business](https://www.microsoft.com/business-store) using the same tenant account you use to sign into Intune.
    
2.  In the Business Store, choose the **Manage** tab, select **Settings**, and choose the **Distribute** tab.
    
3.  If you don't specifically have **Microsoft Intune** available as a mobile device management tool, choose **Add management tool** to add **Microsoft Intune**. If you don't have **Microsoft Intune** activated as your mobile device management tool, click **Activate** next to **Microsoft Intune**. Note that you should activate **Microsoft Intune** rather than **Microsoft Intune Enrollment**.
