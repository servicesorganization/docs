With Microsoft OneDrive, you can easily and securely store and access (personal) files from all your devices on your personal cloud environment. You can work with others regardless of whether they're inside or outside the organization. OneDrive helps protecting data through advanced encryption. With OneDrive on the web, desktop, or mobile, you can access all your personal files plus the files shared with you from other people or teams, including files from Microsoft Teams and SharePoint.

OneDrive provides a robust but simple-to-use cloud storage platform for enterprise organizations. OneDrive enables you to securely share and work together on all your files. With OneDrive, you can:

*   **Access files from all your devices.** Access all your personal files and those files others share with you on all your devices, including mobile, Mac, and PC as well as in a web browser.
    
*   **Share inside or outside your organization.** Securely share files with people inside or outside your organization by using their email address, even if they don't have a Microsoft Services Account. This common sharing experience is available in the web, mobile, and desktop versions of OneDrive.
    
*   **Collaborate with deep Microsoft Office integration.** Document coauthoring is available in Office for the web, Office mobile apps, and Office desktop apps, helping you maintain a single working version of any file. Only OneDrive provides coauthoring capabilities in Office apps across all your devices.
    
*   **Quickly find files that matter most.** Finding content in your OneDrive is simplified through the intelligence of the Microsoft Graph application programming interface. This technology simplifies finding what's important by providing file recommendations based on your relationship to other people, how you received various files, and when you last accessed them.
    
*   **Protect your files with enterprise-grade security.** OneDrive has many security and compliance features, enabling you to meet some of the strictest compliance requirements out there.
