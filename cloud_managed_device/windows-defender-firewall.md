If weâ€™re managing your devices using Microsoft Intune, you may want to control your Windows Defender Firewall policy. A firewall controls what network traffic is allowed and not allowed to pass through ports. For regular devices like laptops and desktops, the firewall should allow little inbound traffic. There is rarely any legitimate reason for other devices to connect to your device, or home network, unsolicited. Therefore, it's important to have Microsoft Defender Firewall switched on to protect your device from unauthorized access.
